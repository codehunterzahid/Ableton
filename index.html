                flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <p class="sec-para2">We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is
                our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p class="sec-para">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters
                in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
            <p class="sec-para2">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push
                every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs,
                some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief
                that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future
                of music culture.</p>
