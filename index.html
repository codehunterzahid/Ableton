                flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</p>
            <p class="sec-para2">We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is
                our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p class="sec-para">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters
                in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
            <p class="sec-para2">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push
                every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs,
                some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief
                that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future
                of music culture.</p>

                products and we strive to make them great.</p>
            <p class="p-pr">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to
                work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that
                are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always
                agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.</p>
            <p class="p-pr">Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new
                knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
                development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best
                practices.</p>

            <p class="p-pr">If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide
                you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive
                health insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office
                hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year
                as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
